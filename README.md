## Rules

1. <strong>Pieces -</strong> Though pieces were traditionally made of wood, now many are made of plastic, though other materials may be used. Pieces are typically flat and cylindrical. They are invariably split into one darker and one lighter color. Traditionally, these colors are red and white, but red and black are common in the United States, and light- and dark-stained wood are supplied with more expensive sets. There are two classes of pieces: "men" and "kings". Kings are differentiated as consisting of two normal pieces of the same color, stacked one on top of the other. Often indentations are added to the pieces to aid stacking.

2. <strong>Starting position -</strong> Each player starts with twelve pieces on the dark spaces of the three rows closest to his own side (as shown in the diagram). The row closest to each player is called the "crownhead" or "kings row". The player with the darker colored pieces moves first.

3. <strong>How to move -</strong> There are two ways to move a piece:

    - A <strong>simple move</strong> involves sliding a piece one space diagonally forwards to an adjacent unoccupieddark square.

    - A <strong>jump</strong> is a move from a square diagonally adjacent to one of the opponent's pieces to an empty square immediately and directly on the opposite side of the opponent's square, thus "jumping directly over" the square containing the opponent's piece. An uncrowned piece may only jump diagonally forwards, kings may jump diagonally backwards. A piece that is jumped is captured and removed from the board.

4. <strong>Kings -</strong> If a player's piece moves into the kings row on the opposing player's side of the board, that piece is said to be "crowned", becoming a "king" and gaining the ability to move both forwards and backwards. If a player's piece jumps into the kings row, the current move terminates; having just been crowned, the piece cannot continue on by jumping back out, until the next move.

5. <strong>How to win -</strong>A player wins by capturing all of the opposing player's pieces or by leaving the opposing player with no legal moves.
